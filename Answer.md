1. Law/ justice system, (an exampe there would no need for a police system since everyone acts justly)

2. Chinese work process , where are workers are overworked and are not given optimal living conditions (production),
these benfitted Chinese economy at the cost a good, healthy life of an individual. For the ethcial code, I think that as long as the group
isn't knowingly and purposefully hurting indivdual then we as society for the betterment of the group

Our idea was "Automated Fast Food (major chain) Establishments"

 

Three immediate downsides are: 
Immediate effect upon unemployment rates in young/uneducated people.
Hacking/Tampering for misuse
Heavy Maintenance Costs - Physical parts, and expensive skilled labor

 

What is the upside/downside at each stage of development?

 

First Stage: 
Public pushback would be inevitable, and expected to be high. However, quality of food, convenience, speed, and consistency would arguably
attempt to quell the overall population. High focus on customer satisfaction would have to be a very high priority on launch. 

 

When it's absorbed into society:
Obesity rates would probably be directly influenced by a major fast food chain being able to offer high quality food for a lower amount of 
money, especially when it tastes good, so people can buy more and enjoy more. New jobs would be given out, and essentially a new outlet for 
skilled labor would be created, where people would study to be electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, software engineers, etc. to 
support the new methods. One lasting effect that would be incredibly important is that if the venture is successful, other companies would
see the shift to automated systems and strive to integrate them into their own infrastructure.

 

Code of Conduct:
Foster trust within the comapny, and value trust with customers
Respect the laws of local and international juristictions
Honor Privacy 
Don't succumb to insider trading
Be honest within evaluations of employees, both of self and of others
Maintain hygiene of self and establishment
Contribute to a safe and productive workplace

 

SABOTAGE

 

To try and combat sabotage, we would have multiple high-skill occupations that have a unique role and goal at every location daily.
These associates would be sent to randomized locations that would be sent to the employees that are going to those locations. This 
attempts to ensure quality work at each location, and prevents stagnation by working at one specific location. Also, we would have
an independant honor system in place so that each employee would "grade" the work of the employee before them, for bonuses, and for
punishments. Employees would not know who graded them, or who they grade, to respect the privacy and eliminate bias for other employees.
This incentivizes great work, and also punishes poor work. Also, this makes it so that if an employee sabotages or deliberately does a 
bad job, when the report is put in daily, corporate can take necessary action against that employee.
